# UnzippingDNA

Note: The files are the supplementary data provided with the original manuscript titled "High nucleotide skew palindromic DNA sequences function as replication origins due to their unzipping propensity"

The OriC seqeunces are downloaded from NCBI and DoriC database. 
The sequence data are given in the .rar file and .csv file.
The matlab code to find the skew in these seqeunce is attached 'SkewInOriC.m'

The algorithms for the calculation of the unzipping time of sequences and rest of the analysis used in the work are given in the file 'Algorithm'.
