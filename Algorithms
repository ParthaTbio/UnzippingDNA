\subsection{Calculation of unzipping time:} 

Inputs: Sequence to unzip, Thermodynamic rates of formation and dissociation of H-bonds, Kinetic modulating factors or cooperative factors (catalytic, inhibiting)

Output: Unzipping time

\subsection*{Algorithm:} 
1. Given the sequence (length = n) find all possible configuration of the sequence during unzipping process

i. Out of n base pairs, depending on whether a H-bond is present or absent construct $2^n$ state space. It will be the permutations of n number of 0's or 1's where 0 is for absence and 1 is for presence of H-bond at nth location of the sequence.

2. As the end base pairs (boundary) of the linear sequence are not to be broken, extend the state space and sequence accordingly. Sequence is extended by adding a C to the 5' end and G to the 3' end. This is because, out of all possibilities only this combination is the faster than others.

3. Construct a transition rate matrix Q of dimension $2^n \times 2^n$ where Q(i,j) represents the transition rate from ith to jth state.

i. The process of defining transition rates is explained in method section

ii. Do note that transitions where more than one H-bond is forming or dissociating is prohibited by making Q(i,j) = 0 for those transition elements

iii. The diagonal elements are calculated by maintaining sum of transitions from a state to all other states state is zero. 

4. Resident time matrix T is calculated using equation 1.

5. unzipping time is the element corresponding to fully zipped state




\subsection{Identifying 5 fastest and slowest unzipping sequences:}

inputs: Sequence length, and parameters

output: The fastest unzipping sequence

\subsection*{Algorithm:}
1. for a given sequence length, store all possible sequences composed of G's and C's 

2. Calculate the unzipping time of all the sequences and compare them to find 5 fastest and 5 slowest unzipping sequences



\subsection{Time evolution of unzipping a sequence:}

input: Consider any sequence (highly skewed one used for observation)

Output: a plot showing variation of probability occupancy of all possible states

\subsection*{Algorithm:}
1.  Following the method explained in calculation of unzipping time, find the transition rate matrix Q

2. To avoid back transition from the target state, make the row zero corresponding to the target state, i.e. fully unzipped state

3. Sample time from zero to 10 times the unzipping time of the sequence

4. Define initial probability occupancy P(0) of each states by a vector of all zeros and one 1 corresponding to the initial state i.e. fully zipped state

5. use equation (3) to calculate change in P at each time scale.

6. Plot P(t) with time (t)


\subsection{Find the phase space for palindrome:}

input: range of sequence length and temperature to consider 

Output: phase space of palindrome

\subsection*{Algorithm: }
1. form a grid of dimension (n, m) where n is the number of temperatures you want to consider, (e.g. 310K to 400K in the gap of 5K) and m is the number of lengths of sequences to consider (minimum of 3) 

2. for each grid entry find the fastest unzipping sequence with corresponding length and temperature.

3. Identify which are palindromic



\subsection{Find Skew in replication origin sequences:}

Input: Organism

Output: Cumulative skew plot

\subsection*{Algorithm:}
1. in ncbi-databse search for the key word 'rep\_origin' and filter for organism (e.g. mitochondria)

2. Download the sequences

3. Extract the replication origin sequence by using the index in the feature file specified by starting and ending location of replication origins.

4. Store all such sequences in a matrix A by replacing purines by -1 and pyrimidines by +1

5. As the sequences are of different lengths, center align all the sequences by putting 0's where nt is absent.

6. Find cumulative sum of each row and store in a different matrix B

7. Find sum of B for each column

8. Find number of nonzero entries in A for each column and divide it to B to normalize the skew

9. Plot the final sum in y with sequence coordinate in x

10. the sum of nonzero entries in A will give the sequence count to plot in secondary y axis in a bar plot
